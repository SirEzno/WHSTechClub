How to use games:

1) Open up the branches tab, find the game that interests you
2) Download the branch to your pc
3) In file explorer, find the C: drive
4) Create a folder named "games" inside the C drive
5) Bring the downloaded file into the games folder
6) Extract it to the games folder
7) Find the exe and play! Just a warning, not all games might work, as the school PCs can be weird.
