Sticky Cats
Version 1.0
===================
Sticky Cats is a 2 - 4 player party game in which you control a manic cat with a craving for fish. The goal of the game is to traverse each house and escape with the fish before anyone else does.


Local Play (Offline):
===============
To play an offline game with friends, choose “start” from the main menu.
Each player requires a gamepad to play, but one player can play on a keyboard if necessary (although gamepads are recommended).

Gamepad Controls:

Start/triangle button: Join game
Joystick: Move/aim for jumping
A or X button : Jump
Back button: Restart level

Keyboard Controls: 
(Note: Only 1 player can use the keyboard)

Enter: Join game
WASD/Arrow keys: Move/aim for jumping
Space: Jump
R: Restart level


Online Play:
=========
You can play online with either the keyboard or a gamepad.
To start an online game, choose the “play online” option from the main menu. In the next screen, choose a name for yourself. 
If you want to play online with friends, you can specify a room name that you all join, so that you all play in the same game. Enter that name in the room name field, and press “join game” to start.
If you want to play against random strangers, you can leave the room name blank, and the game will try and find a room with people in it to play against.
